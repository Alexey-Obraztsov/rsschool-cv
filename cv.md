# About Me
I am 23 years old, I work as an aviation engineer. A year ago I became interested in front-end development and I want to try myself in this field. I am interested in constantly developing, learning something new. I don't see great prospects in my job, so I decided to study programming, which is developing at a tremendous speed.

# My strengths:

# Code Examples
Repeat a given string str (first argument) for num times (second argument). Return an empty string if num is not a positive number. For the purpose of this challenge, do not use the built-in .repeat() method.

```
function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) {
  var accumulatedStr = "";

  while (num > 0) {
    accumulatedStr += str;
    num--;
  }

  return accumulatedStr;
}
```
